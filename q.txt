I want to add more features to the data acquisition section.

1. Add a new section called Headphone. You can load a curve and the target is one of targets available in the ./data_tests/targets directory.

When selecting a Headphone:
- the curve choice is not available in the eq design section.
- The possible loss are headphone-loss and headphone-flat.
